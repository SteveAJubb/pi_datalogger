To install:
Place the datalogger folder in /home/pi
Edit tcp_server.py and change the TCP_IP variable to the IP of the raspberry pi (more information on the variables in this script can be found in README.docx.
Run the install.sh script as root: 
   sudo ./install.sh

Confirm installation:
Restart the raspberry pi.
Use htop or top to check if "python3 /home/pi/datalogger/tcp_server.py" is running.

Troubleshooting:
If it turns out that the script isn't running make sure that the TCP_IP is set correctly, and try restarting again.
If this is not working try starting the module manually by typing: 
   sudo systemctl start tcp
If it is still not working try:
   sudo systemctl status tcp
to get more information.
If you are able to start the module but it won't start on boot try running:
   sudo systemctl enable tcp.
You also might want to try running the tcp_server.py scipt seperately to see if it gives you any errors:
   sudo ./tcp_server.py
